## About the Project
I built this project to deepen my understanding of C# programming and game physics within the Unity engine. 
This was made for my high school capstone project 😁😁😁

### Platform
Windows Only (sry mac)

### Technical Features
* **Player Controller:** Custom C# script handling velocity, jump physics, and ground detection using Raycasts.
* **State Management:** Implemented logic to handle different character states (Idle, Running, Jumping, Falling).
* **Collision Detection:** Logic for interacting with platforms and environmental hazards.
* **Camera Tracking:** Script to smoothly follow the player using linear interpolation (Lerp).
